# Homework-3-Machine-Learning-Unsupervised-Learning
We look at the structure of data and not its corresponding output Y. By looking at the structure of data we can better understand the given data. We can do this using various unsupervised machine learning algorithms, but in this case I am using an autoencoder to model the structure of the inputs.
